# Architecture

## Overview

This is a frontend-only React application built with Vite and TypeScript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI components.
The application currently operates using **mock data** and has no active backend integration, though `tanstack/react-query` is installed for future data fetching.

It appears to be a **Lead Management System (LMS)** with distinct views/functionality for different user roles (Admin, Agent, Manager).

## Components

### Core
- **Pages:** `src/pages/` - Contains route-based views, including specialized subdirectories for `admin`, `agent`, and `manager`.
- **UI Components:** `src/components/` - Likely contains Shadcn UI and custom components.
- **Entry Point:** `src/main.tsx` - Bootstraps the React application.
- **App Root:** `src/App.tsx` - Likely handles routing and layout.

### Data Layer
- **Mock Data:** `src/data/mockData.ts` - Central source of truth for application data (Leads, Agents, Users, Activities, Notifications).
- **Query Client:** `tanstack/react-query` is installed but likely operating on mocks or unprepared for real API calls.

## Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI (e.g., LeadManagement page).
2.  **Data Retrieval**: Components import data directly from `src/data/mockData.ts`.
3.  **State Management**: Local React state, React Context, and `sonner` for toast notifications.

## Integration Points

| Service | Type | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| Supabase/Firebase | Database | Potential future backend | **Not Implemented** |
| API | REST/GraphQL | Data fetching | **Not Implemented** |

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Hardcoded Data**: Application relies entirely on `mockData.ts`. Needs migration to a real backend.
- [ ] **Authentication**: `Login.tsx` exists but likely lacks real auth logic (JWT/Oauth).
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: No database connection; changes are lost on refresh (unless using localStorage, to be verified).
- [ ] **Unused Dependencies**: `tanstack/react-query` might be underutilized until backend is ready.

## Conventions

- **Naming**: PascalCase for components (`LeadManagement.tsx`), camelCase for hooks (`use-toast.ts`).
- **Structure**: Feature-based grouping in `pages` (admin, agent, manager).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with utility classes.
