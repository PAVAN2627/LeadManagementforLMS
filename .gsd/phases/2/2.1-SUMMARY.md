# Plan 2.1 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- Created `Lead` and `Note` Mongoose models with required schemas.
- Implemented `/api/leads` endpoint:
  - Supports role-based filtering (Agents see only assigned leads).
  - Validates input with Zod.
  - Automatically populates `assignedTo` field.
- Implemented `/api/leads/[id]` endpoint:
  - Handles GET, PUT, DELETE operations.
  - Enforces RBAC (Agents can't view others' leads).
  - Handles deletions correctly (including cascading note deletion - *Note: Implemented basic note cleanup logic in delete handler*).

## Next Steps
- Validate with Seed script in Plan 2.2.
